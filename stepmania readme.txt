Welcome to the StepMania version of Fonts 5 - Evanescence, it is personified! As that inferno fluxuates, so does the penultimate of the heptads, the one commanding the iconoclastic apparitions! At world end, rock and heaven, soul and sea, fade, yet it does not matter. For that melody had long since saved all. It has already reached [AMORTALITY]!

Although you could say that this is the "original" version because I made all the maps in here. After doing that, I would just open the .sm in Notepad++, ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+v into a script in GameMaker. I also made Night of Past flux, lancer raps flux, and half of Night Falls ~ Evening Star before starting Fonts 5.

Anyway, no mods here. Hopefully the maps should work the same without it.
Fonts 5 stage 2, Lancer Raps, features a double lane mechanic. You can probably guess how it works in StepMania.

Noteskins:
Everything was based off of midi-solo because that's the noteskin I've always used as far back as the first dancegame I played, DDR Hottest Party 3 on wii. (it's kinda different there but they key point is that the shape is the same)
I promise, it's not just because I was too bad to make fully unique ones. I wanted every noteskin to have the same shape so it wouldn't be super weird going between songs.

Anyway they're all here. I have no idea how to make noteskin files from the ground up so I just copied some other ones and replaced the assets. I tested it, hopefully it works for everyone else. The file setup is likely massively inefficient.

By the way, I play on an outdated version of both SM5 and the Simply Love theme. The pack shows up for me, but it might not in every version because of the Japanese bracket-quote-things I used. Feel free to remove them if this is a problem.
