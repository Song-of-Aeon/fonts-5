fonts five - side story includes the peripheral maps of fonts five and also two that were never intended to be in fonts five but i made anyway. it's raining somewhere else and nocturne are very easy and short because in fonts five they only act as cutscene maps.

yume ga aru is supposed to be here but i originally made it with japanese text in the title and there is a nonzero chance it will just refuse to show up. for some reason otome no route wa hitotsu janai doesn't have that problem? well, at least that's a more pleasant map to play.
