Fonts 5 - Evanescence, it is personified! As that inferno fluxuates, so does the penultimate of the heptads, the one commanding the iconoclastic apparitions! At world end, rock and heaven, soul and sea, fade, yet it does not matter. For that melody had long since saved all. It has already reached [AMORTALITY]

A game by Aeon.
Just like all free computer rhythm games, it violates copyright because of its songs. If you're one of the people in the credits and that's a problem for you you can send something about it to aeon#2682 (Discord) or @Espeon78 (Twitter) and I'll get to it, unless you're the guy that made the midi-solo noteskin. I need that shit my guy.

POTENTIALLY ASKED QUESTIONS (PAQ):

Q: "Why is the game called Fonts 5 - Evanescence, it is personified! As that inferno fluxuates, so does the penultimate of the heptads, the one commanding the iconoclastic apparitions! At world end, rock and heaven, soul and sea, fade, yet it does not matter. For that melody had long since saved all. It has already reached [AMORTALITY]?"
A: Ha ha, I get this one a lot.

Q: "I hate your engine. Let me play StepMania properly."
A: Yes yes you can download the StepMania version from the same page. It doesn't have any mods or gimmicks but features pure note action.

Q: "Your engine is great! How did you make it?"
A: GameMaker 1.4. They don't sell it anymore so if you want it you'll need a Steam key reseller or to just pirate it. Source code for Fonts 5 is linked on the download page. Should be importable into GMS2 without too many problems? I don't know, I don't have it.

Q: "Damn! Why is everything so weirdly organized in the code?"
A: Originally I made Fonts 5 in ten days. It sucked back then and it's a lot better now but some of that organization is still there so you get things like the code that saves your scores is in the screen fade transition object.

Q: "It says I got a 100 on this song! I didn't at all!"
A: Shouldn't happen but I'm working on it.

Q: "Did you really steal a joke from the Hello Penguin magazine volume 1 for the first answer in this PAQ?"
A: I prefer to call it a derivative work.

Q: "Fonts 6 when?"
A: I dunno. Before Yandere Simulator lol.

Q: "Will you map a song for me?"
A: Aight. 10 USD per difficulty for a reasonable length song and +10 more for cool mods and a noteskin. Four bucks off both if it's a song I really like. aeon#2682

Q: "Why is it so hard? The easy mode isn't easy at all!"
A: Made for dancegame veterans. It is tough though. I can't even clear Eon Break or Everything Will Freeze on Flux very well. From the start, I was trying to map above my level.

Q: "Five keyboard ways of control aren't enough!"
A: Yeah well it supports controller, which also has five ways of control. Everything except start and select works as a direction. I recommend the Ls and Rs or joystick + ABXY.

Q: "What's with the locked room in the back of Sans' and Papyrus' house?"
A: Ah, that's a very well-hidden secret. When you reach the Last Corridor for the first time on pacifist, load after Sans' speech a couple times and continue listening to him. Eventually, he'll give you a key that you can use to get another key to open it.

Q: "What happened to Fonts 1-4?"
A: "Why did the chicken cross the road", "Why couldn't they beat Air Man", these are all impossible questions to answer.


There are five fonts featured in Fonts 5.

Alien Encounters (title, menu, combo),
Rondalo (descriptions, info, dialogue),
Andes (story mode intro cutscene),
Chromatic (judgement),
and Courier New ("<Start();" and difficulty selector cursor)

I considered having the prologue RTF in Rondalo to fit, but if the user didn't have that font installed it would have shown up as Arial or something else gross so it's a simple and clean Calibri instead.

Thats, uh
That's it.
Seeya.
